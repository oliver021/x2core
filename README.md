# X2Core

A library to develop your web applications through a lightweight, stable, extensible and quality system. This package is simply a set of well-organized classes that gives you a way to develop your projects with very good practices and very popular patterns.

Basically we have a class called QuickApplication from where we are going to obtain a very complete set of functionalities to develop an application in php, through an event-oriented architecture and with the possibility of implementing MVC among other well-known patterns and programming practices.

In addition to our aforementioned class, we will have a super varied set of utilities that allows us to work on a more semantic and consistent PHP.
